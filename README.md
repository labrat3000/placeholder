# wizard101 auto trivia greasemonkey script

forked from Jan-FCloud's github (now defunct)

currently it auto-solves most trivia. some trivia seem to get stuck on certain questions and i can't be bothereed enough to figure it out. just answer those ones randomly and you get it like 98% of the time.
